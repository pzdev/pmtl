# DyNet
Dynamic neural network library

DyNet (formerly known as [cnn](http://github.com/clab/cnn-v1)) is a neural network library developed by Carnegie Mellon University and many others. It is written in C++ (with bindings in Python) and is designed to be efficient when run on either CPU or GPU, and to work well with networks that have dynamic structures that change for every training instance. For example, these kinds of networks are particularly important in natural language processing tasks, and DyNet has been used to build state-of-the-art systems for [syntactic parsing](https://github.com/clab/lstm-parser), [machine translation](https://github.com/neubig/lamtram), [morphological inflection](https://github.com/mfaruqui/morph-trans), and many other application areas.
